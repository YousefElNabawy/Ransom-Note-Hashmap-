Explanation
  1. Counting: We count each character in magazine by incrementing the respective index in the count array.
  2. Validation: For each character in ransomNote, we decrement the count in the array. If at any point the count for a character goes below zero, it indicates that magazine doesn’t have enough of that character to     satisfy ransomNote.
  3. Result: If we process all characters in ransomNote without issues, we return true.



bool canConstruct(char* ransomNote, char* magazine) {
    int count[26] = {0}; // Array to hold counts of each letter in magazine

    // Count each letter in magazine
    for (int i = 0; magazine[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        count[magazine[i] - 'a']++;   //This line counts how many times each letter appears in magazine.
    }

    // Check each letter in ransomNote
    for (int i = 0; ransomNote[i] != '\0'; i++) {
        // Decrease the count for the letter in ransomNote
        if (--count[ransomNote[i] - 'a'] < 0) {
            // If any letter count goes below zero, we don't have enough letters ,This line checks if there are enough occurrences of a particular letter in magazine to satisfy the requirement in ransomNote.
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true; // All letters in ransomNote are accounted for
}
